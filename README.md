Code Alpha - Task Automation with Python Script
This is my second project for the Code Alpha Internship. In this task, I created a Python script that automates the process of retrieving a specified number of image URLs based on user input. The user can choose the target object or category of images, and the script fetches the URLs automatically. Once the URLs are obtained, the images are downloaded and saved to the specified folder.

Key Features:
Allows users to define the number of images they want to retrieve.
Fetches image URLs based on user-specified keywords.
Downloads the images from the retrieved URLs into a designated folder.
Currently, I am completing my internship virtually with Code Alpha, where I have been working on multiple projects involving Python programming.
